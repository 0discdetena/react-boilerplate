In this review, we will take a closer look at the Virtavia AS365N Dauphin for FSX and see how it performs in various scenarios. We will also compare it with some real-world specifications and photos of the Dauphin.
 
## Installation and Documentation
 
The installation process is straightforward and easy. After purchasing the product from simMarket[^1^] [^2^], you will receive a download link and a serial number. You will need to enter the serial number during the installation. The installer will automatically detect your FSX or FS2004 folder and install the files accordingly.
 
The documentation consists of a 17-page PDF manual that covers the installation, features, panel descriptions, checklists, reference tables, and repaint information. The manual is well-written and informative, with clear screenshots and diagrams. It also provides some background information on the history and development of the Dauphin.
 
## Models and Liveries
 
The package includes four models of the AS365N Dauphin: N1, N2 VIP, N2 MedEvac, and N2 Military. The N1 model has a shorter nose and smaller engines than the N2 model. The N2 VIP model has a more spacious cabin with leather seats and a table. The N2 MedEvac model has a stretcher and medical equipment in the cabin. The N2 Military model has a winch on the right side of the fuselage.
 
The package also includes eight liveries that represent various operators of the Dauphin around the world. They are:
 
- AS365 N1 Swift Copters (Switzerland)

The models and liveries are very well done, with high-resolution textures and accurate details. The exterior models have realistic reflections, shadows, animations, and effects. The interior models have 3D gauges, switches, levers, pedals, and controls that are all functional and mousable. The cabin doors can be opened and closed by clicking on them or using keyboard commands.
